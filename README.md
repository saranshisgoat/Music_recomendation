# Overview
This project aims to build a music recommendation system using machine learning techniques. The recommendation system is designed to provide personalized song suggestions to users based on their listening history and other relevant features.

# Dependencies
R
R packages: data.table, lubridate, ggplot2, shiny, glmnet, shinydashboard, shinyjs, caret, rpart, randomForest, etc.
# Setup
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/music-recommendation-project.git
cd music-recommendation-project
Install dependencies:

R
Copy code
# Install required R packages
install.packages(c("data.table", "lubridate", "ggplot2", "shiny", "glmnet", "shinydashboard", "shinyjs", "caret", "rpart", "randomForest"))
Run the Shiny app locally:

R
Copy code
shiny::runApp("web_app/app.R")
# Data Collection
The data for this project is sourced from [provide dataset source]. It includes information about users, songs, listening history, and more.

# Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing involves handling missing values, transforming data types, and preparing the data for analysis and modeling. Refer to the scripts in the scripts/ directory for more details.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA is performed to understand the dataset better. Visualizations using ggplot2 provide insights into the distribution of listening events, user behavior, and song popularity.

# Model Development
The project utilizes various machine learning models, including logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests. The optimal model is selected based on performance metrics.

# Model Training
The models are trained on a preprocessed dataset. The scripts/train_model.R script contains the training code. The trained models are saved in the models/ directory.

# Web Integration
The recommendation model is integrated into a Shiny web application (web_app/app.R) to provide users with an interactive interface for song suggestions.

# Deploying the Model
The trained model can be serialized using saveRDS and deployed to production. For example:

R
Copy code
saveRDS(logistic_model, file = "models/logistic_regression_model.rds")
